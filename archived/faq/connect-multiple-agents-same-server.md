Yes! You can connect hundreds of decentralised agents all over the world connected to one centralised server.  
However, for the moment, you'll have to use the same configuration for all your agents as mentioned [here](/faq/configure-different-agents/).

Check [Install HoneyTrap Agent ](/manuals/installing-agent/) for more informations.
