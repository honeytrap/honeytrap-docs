## Contributing to Documentation

### Reporting Documentation Issues

honeytrap.io uses github issues to track documentation issues and requests. If you see a documentation issue, submit an issue using the following steps:

1. Check the [honeytrap.io issues list](https://github.com/honeytrap/honeytrap-docs/issues) as you might find out the issue is a duplicate.
2. Use the [included template for every new issue](https://github.com/honeytrap/honeytrap-docs/issues/new).  When you create a bug report, include as many details as possible and include suggested fixes to the issue.

Note that code issues should be filed against the main HoneyTrap repository, while documentation issues should go in the HoneyTrap-docs repository.

### Submitting Documentation Pull Requests

If you're fixing an issue in the existing documentation, you should submit a PR against the master branch.
