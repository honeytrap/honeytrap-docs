## Description

The `socket` listener allows to choose on which ports you want to listen on as "providers" of traffic.

When starting HoneyTrap with a Socket listener, for each port opened you will be displayed:

```bash
09:54:45.990 listeners/socket â–¶ INFO 00b Listener started: tcp/:8022
```

This means that HoneyTrap is now listening on tcp/8022.  

Use `type="netstack"` to activate this listener.


## Syntax

```bash
[listener]

# the listener type.
type="socket"
```

## How many?

There needs to be one listener and there **can only be one**.  

However, you can define and open several ports linked to several services.


## Arguments in the configuration file

 argument  | default setting | explanation
