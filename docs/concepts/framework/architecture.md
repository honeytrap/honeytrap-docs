## Main concepts

The honeytrap mainly consists of three system types:

|-
| Object | Explanation
|:-:|:-
| [![HoneyTrap Agent](/images/architecture/agent.png)](/docs/concepts/framework/honeytrap-agent/) | Follow [this guide](/docs/setup/agent/landing/) to setup the HoneyTrap Agent.
| [![HoneyTrap Server](/images/architecture/server.png)](/docs/concepts/framework/honeytrap-server/) | Follow [this guide](/docs/setup/server/install-server/) to setup the HoneyTrap Server.
| [![HoneyTrap Sensor](/images/architecture/sensor.png)](/docs/concepts/framework/honeytrap-sensor/) | Follow [this guide](/docs/setup/sensor/install-sensor/) to setuop the HoneyTrap Sensor.

## Sub-Architectures

There are several ways of implementing the HoneyTrap framework. The most common architectures are as follows:
