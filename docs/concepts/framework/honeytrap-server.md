title: HoneyTrap Server
---

This is the central management system for the HoneyTrap framework. Several [listeners](/docs/concepts/objects/listeners/), [services](/docs/concepts/objects/services/), [directors](/docs/concepts/objects/directors/) and [channels](/docs/concepts/objects/channels/) are available. It is possible to connect multiple [agents]() or [sensors]() to the same HoneyTrap Server. It is even possible to run the Server stand alone. This system is available as Docker container, or can be compiled from source.
