title: Scripter
---

{% capture overview %}
Scripters can be used to add extra functionality to existing services, or to implement 
new services/protocols, without having to rebuild the Honeytrap project.

At this time only scripts in the Lua language are accepted, but more may be added in the future. 
In this chapter it is explained how to add scripts and how to create new ones.
