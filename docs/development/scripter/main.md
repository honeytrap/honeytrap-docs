title: Adding scripter functionality
---

There are two ways to extend the functionalities of Honeytrap, either extend existing services,
or implement new ones using scripts.
This can be done by following the documentation on scripts given in the configuration chapter and after that, 
add scripts to 'scripts' directory.

In the chapters 'extending' and 'generic', the implementations of both types can be found.
A list of callable methods can be found in the chapter 'methods'.

If you wish to get new scripts, you can download these from the following git repository, or add this
repository as git submodule to your honeytrap project:
https://github.com/HoneyBEP/scripts
