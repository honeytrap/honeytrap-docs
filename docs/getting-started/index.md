This section provides instructions for installing Honeytrap and setting up Honeytrap. 

## Installation

### Install Go

```
$ cd /usr/local
$ wget https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.9.linux-amd64.tar.gz
$ tar vxf go1.9.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

### Installation from source

#### Linux

```
$ apt install -y libpcap-dev lxc-dev

$ mkdir /opt/honeytrap
$ cd /opt/honeytrap/

$ export GOPATH=/opt/honeytrap
$ export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin/

$ go get github.com/honeytrap/honeytrap/...

$ cp config.toml.sample config.toml
$ $GOPATH/bin/honeytrap
```

#### Docker

Playing with Honeytrap is the easiest by just starting our docker image. The image is automatically being built by the continuous integration of our master branch. 

```
docker run -i -t -p 5900:5900 -p 8022:8022 -v (pwd)/config-docker.toml:/config/config.toml -v (pwd)/data:/data/ honeytrap/honeytrap:latest 
```

This will use the config-docker.toml file in the current directory and forward ports 5900 and 8022 to the docker instance. 

## Packages

We plan to have packages for the following operating systems.

#### MacOS

We will create a brew trap to install Honeytrap.

```
brew install honeytrap
```
