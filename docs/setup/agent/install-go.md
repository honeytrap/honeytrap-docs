## Installing Go

**Note:** The version numbers being listed may vary from the latest version. Always make sure to download the latest version on the [official download page](https://golang.org/dl/).

### Linux and Mac OS

```
$ cd /usr/local
$ wget https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.10.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
$ tar vxf go1.10.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

Another way of installing Go for Mac OS is by installing the provided [installation package](https://golang.org/dl/#featured).

### FreeBSD

```
$ cd /usr/local
$ wget https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.10.1.freebsd-amd64.tar.gz
$ tar vxf go1.10.1.freebsd-amd64.tar.gz
```

### Windows

The easiest way to install Go for Windows is by executing the [installation package](https://golang.org/dl/#featured). By default, the Go distribution will be installed in `c:\Go`.

Another way of installing Go for Windows, is by extracting the provided [x64](https://golang.org/dl/#stable) or [x84](https://golang.org/dl/#stable) zip file to a directory (for example `c:\Go`). When installing Go to another directory, make sure to set the GOROOT environment variable to the chosen path. Also add the `bin` subdirectory of your Go root (for example, `c:\Go\bin`) to your PATH environment variable.
